A bad penny always turns up
A barking dog never bites
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
A cat may look at a king
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link
A change is as good as a rest
All's well that ends well.
Bad news travels fast.
Well begun is half done.
Birds of a feather flock together.
